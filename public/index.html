<p><strong>Justin Thibault, P.E., PMP</strong> Senior Technical Leader, </p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Solid record of employing strategic collaboration, innovation and technical leadership to solve electric sector data science and analytics challenges in both Energy Supply and Power Delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Big Data Architecture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provided project management, technical, and organizational expertise to the EPRI&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiative coordinating a disparate group of experts to develop data governance, architecture and workflow to support advanced use of utility data across the energy sector including generation data, smart meter, and power data. This initiative enhances the Institute&rsquo;s capabilities supporting smart grid and electrification projects.</li>
<li>Currently leading the Power Generation Common Information Model (PG-CIM) project which is extending the IEC CIM - which supports AMI and other smart grid integration - into power generation application integration. PG-CIM is developed by a multidisciplinary team servicing a diverse set of stakeholders in power generation, IT and InfoSec organizations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applied Data Science</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Currently leading the Work Order Data (<u>WODATA</u>) initiative for the Generation sector which leverages a low-code business intelligence (BI) tool (Qlik) to provide business insights and enhance data quality for use in AI workflows. The pilot includes utility data from utilities in 3 countries representing more than $7 billion worth of work orders.</li>
<li>Leading the development of the Asset Management Data Platform (AMDP) which connects EPRI&rsquo;s Preventive Maintenance Basis Database (PMBD) and other systems into a web service. This API will be able to deliver industry benchmarks and insights leveraging data science architectures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Leadership </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Founded a peer-development group among data scientists employing a shared leadership model to enhance collaboration, develop skills, and share technical leadership experiences among experienced and aspiring data scientists.</li>
<li>Applied various agile techniques in projects in data science, IT, cyber security, equipment reliability and software development</li>
